And though Harry's horrible uncles are quick to confiscate the letters, on Harry's eleventh birthday a gigantic man named Rubeus Hagrid, whose eyes glow like black beetles, bursts in with extraordinary news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has been granted a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
